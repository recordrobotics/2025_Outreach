FRC 2025 Robot Control System
=============================

This is the documentation for the `2025_Control <https://github.com/recordrobotics/2025_Control>`__
repository code. If you are new to the progamming team or trying to understand
a piece of code you didn't write, use this to help you understand what each subsystem does
and the theory behind it.

and the ``WPILib`` code structure.
