Quirks and Bugs
---------------

Here is a list of the known quirks and bugs
with the documentation and editing software.
Feel free to add whatever you encounter to here
to help other members.

- The ``Esbonio`` extension does not support spaces
  in the python binary path.
- The Live Preview does not update ``.. toctree::``
  entries. First, delete the ``docs/build`` directory
  and then build (see :ref:`manual-building`).
- If a manual build does not work, try deleting
  the ``docs/build`` directory to cause a fresh build.
